# Project Code Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the code used for a project involving data processing, analysis, and visualization. The project utilizes various libraries and techniques to perform data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Table of Contents

1. **DataProcessor Class**
   - Creating and interacting with a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy
   - Creating tables with specific columns in the database
   - Loading data from CSV files into the database tables

2. **Load Data from Database Function**
   - Loading data from three tables (train, ideal, and test) into separate pandas DataFrames

3. **Understanding the Data**
   - Displaying the number of rows and columns in each dataset
   - Providing a statistical description of the datasets
   - Displaying the first few rows of each dataset

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Creating scatter plots to observe the distribution of data
   - Identifying outliers in the train dataset using box plots

5. **Deviation Calculation**
   - Calculating the minimum deviations between train and ideal datasets
   - Identifying the ideal function label with the minimum deviation for each train set

6. **Mapping Points and Visualization**
   - Mapping points based on deviations and specified criteria
   - Visualizing the scatter plot of mapped points and actual y-values
   - Visualizing the residual plot of residuals vs. mapped y-values

## DataProcessor Class

The DataProcessor class provides methods to create and interact with a SQLite database. It includes methods to create tables with specific columns and load data from CSV files into those tables.

## Load Data from Database Function

The `load_data_from_db` function establishes a connection to the SQLite database and loads data from the train, ideal, and test tables into separate pandas DataFrames.

## Understanding the Data

This section provides insights into the dataset's characteristics by displaying the number of rows and columns, statistical descriptions, and the first few rows of the train, ideal, and test datasets.

## Data Visualization

The `visulization` class contains methods to create scatter plots and box plots for data visualization. Scatter plots help observe the distribution of data, while box plots assist in identifying outliers in the train dataset.

## Deviation Calculation

The `calculate_deviations` function calculates the minimum deviations between train and ideal datasets. It identifies the ideal function label with the minimum deviation for each train set.

## Mapping Points and Visualization

The `test_ideal_deviations` function merges the test dataset with four chosen ideal functions. The `mapping_points` function maps points based on deviations and specified criteria. Visualization of the chosen ideal functions and scatter plots of mapped points and residuals are provided.
